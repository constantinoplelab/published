# ofc_glm: generalized linear modeling and clustering of lOFC responses

This is the code used in [Hocker D, Brody CD, Savin C, Constantinople CM. Subpopulations of neurons in lOFC encode previous and current rewards at time of choice. eLife 2021;10:e70129](https://elifesciences.org/articles/70129)

The analysis in this work was based on two primary sets of analysis:
1) building and fitting a generalized linear model to lOFC responses
2) performing clustering on lOFC neural data to understand the population-level organization of neural responses. 

1. GLM. The general workflow of the code is the following
	- to first load in behavioral and neural data and build a design matrix based on the behavioral data 
	- Choose a basis set for parametrizing the kernels
	- Fit the model and hyperparameters
	- Check model fit, behavior, and encoding features
	
2. Clustering. The general workflow for clustering is the following:
	- Create a feature space for clustering
	- Calculate the PAIRS statistic to check if clusters exist
	- Calculate the gap statistic for k-means clustering on that feature space

## Demos
Simple examples have been provided for the following:
* visualizing cluster-averaged responsed
* fitting a single neuron GLM model
* running the clustering pipeline
	- build a feature space
	- calculate the PAIRS statistic
	- calculate the gap statistic
* calculating CPD for a sample neuron
* calculating mutual information for a sample neuron
