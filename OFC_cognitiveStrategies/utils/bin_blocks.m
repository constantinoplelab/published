function [blockbins, all] = bin_blocks(A, block, numbins, transitiontype, idx, exclude_congr)
%%%select trials from different bins of a certain
%%%block type. cmc August 2024
%% INPUTS:
%% 1. A is behavior data struct.
%% 2. block is the block type you want to select (1 = mixed, 2 = high, 3 = low).
%% 3. transitiontype specifies the preceding block type, calculated by
%% diff(A.block). So -1 = high-mixed (2-1)
%% 4. idx is a logical vector indicating which trials to include/exclude
%% (e.g., if you want to look early vs. late in training)
%% 5. exclude_congr is a logical that indicates whether the mixed block
%% should be divided into terciles using all trials, or just those following
%% the first incongruent one.
%% OUTPUTS:
%% 1. blockbins is a cell(numbins,1) of trial indices in each bin.
%% 2. all combines all bins, e.g., if you just want to condition on
%% previous block type
