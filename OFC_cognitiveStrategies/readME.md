# OFCpaper: analysis of behavior and neural activity early and late in learning of hidden states in a temporal wagering task

This is the code used in [Schiereck, S. S., PÃ©rez-Rivera, D. T., Mah, A., DeMaegd, M. L.,Hocker, D., Ward, R. M., Savin, C., & Constantinople, C. M. Neural dynamics in the orbitofrontal cortex reveal cognitive strategies] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.29.620879v2).

The analyses and figures are broken into 5 primary sets:
1. Analysis of expert rat's behavior during the task along with model predictions
2. Analysis of OFC inactivation data
3. Analysis of expert electrophysiology data
4. Analysis of behavior early in learning (block naive) along with model predictions
5. Analysis of block naive electrophysiology data
