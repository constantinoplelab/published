# dynamic_learning_rate: analysis of a dynamic learning rate in rats and its effect on dopamine signalling in the nucleus accumbens 

This is the code used in [Mah, A., Golden, C. E., Constantinople, C. M. C. Dopamine transients encode reward prediction errors independent of learning rates.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.18.590090v2)

The analyses are broken to three primary sets:
1. Analysis of rat's behavior during the task
2. Analysis of behavioral models fit to the rat's behavior
3. Analysis of photometry data
