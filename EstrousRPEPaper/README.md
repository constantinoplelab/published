# EstrousRPEPaper: analysis of reward prediction error and dopamine signalling in the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning across the estrous cycle

This is the code used in [Golden, C.E.M., Martin, A.C., Kaur, D., Mah, A., Levy, D.H., Yamaguchi, T., Lasek, A., Lin, D., Aoki, C., Constantinople, C.M. Estrogenic control of reward prediction errors and reinforcement learning.] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.09.570945v2.)

The analyses are broken into five primary sets:
1. Analysis of rat's behavior during the task
2. Analysis of photometry data
3. Analysis of model fits to and predictions of rat's behavior
4. Analysis of effect of optogenetic stimulation on rat behavior
5. Analysis of molecular signatures and manipulation of rat behavior
